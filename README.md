one long list used to capture every possible action that springs into one's mind.

There is a minimum of special markings or annotations.

Three main requirements which have to be kept in balance:
* Urgency
* Importance
* Psychological readiness


The FV  Algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, all tasks entered one after another on a never-ending list.

Determining what to action in a session preselects of chain of actions based on the question "What do I want to do before I do x?"

The chain always starts with the first unactioned task on the never-ending list.

Mark this task with a dot to show that it's now been preselected but don't take any action on the task at this stage.

This task then becomes the benchmark from which the next task is selected.

The question becomes "What do I want to do before I do that task?"

You iteratively proceed through the list, picking tasks you would rather do, and making that task the benchmark for the next iteration.

Continue until you reach the end of the list.

This preselected list becomes a locked todo list.


Do these in reverse order.

You don't have to finish the task - only do some work on it. If you don't finish the task, re-enter the task at the end of the list.

Once you have taken action on all the preselected tasks, preselect another chain of tasks starting again from the first unactioned task on the list.

If the first task on the list can't be done now for some valid reason (e.g. wrong time of day, precondition not met, bad weather), then cross it out and re-enter it at the end of the list. Use the next task as your starting benchmark.

If at any stage you find that a task on the list is no longer relevant, then delete it.

If you find that your preselected list is no longer relevant (e.g. if you have had a long break away from the list), then scrap the preselection and reselect from the beginning.

If one or more very urgent things come up, write them at the end of the list and mark them with a dot so that they are done next. If something already on the list becomes very urgent, then move it to the end of the list and mark it with a dot in the same way.

How the three factors are addressed:

* Urgency. Because of the nature of the preselection process, urgent tasks tend to get selected - generally speaking the human brain wants to do things that it knows are urgent. If things come up that are particularly urgent they can be added to the preselected list at any time.

* Importance. Generally speaking the human brain is a bit less keen on doing important stuff than it is on doing urgent stuff. This is particularly the case when the important stuff is difficult. However the FV preselection process ensures that tasks towards the beginning of the list are given as much attention as tasks towards the end of the list.

* Psychological Readiness. This is where FV really enters new dimensions. By using a pre-selection process, the brain is softened up towards the selected tasks. But this isn't all. The selection process is based on what you want to do. This colours the whole preselected list so that even the first task, which you may not have wanted to do at all, gets affected. In addition, doing the list in reverse order, with the least wanted task last, uses structured procrastination to get the tasks done.

* How to run projects
-- consider letting there be subdivisions included in the list or not, that are associated as steps of another step.

* Someday/Maybe

* How will I collect data to determine how one is proceeding, some items that have crossed my mind:

1. list growth to processing (biting off more than one can chew)
2. Time spent on given tasks/projects
3. Number of times a task is re-visited.
4. Statistics on when preselections get abandoned (daily biting off more than one can chew).
